# Security Review for SentimentAnalysisMobile

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Changes Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables Configuration
- Created `.env.example` template file with placeholder values
- Added support for reading environment variables in the Supabase client:
  - Using Expo Constants
  - Using process.env with EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix
  - Still maintaining backward compatibility with hardcoded values during transition

### 2. Enhanced .gitignore 
- Added exclusions for all environment files (except .env.example)
- Added patterns to catch credential and config files
- Added exclusions for local databases

### 3. Code Security
- Updated supabaseClient.js to use a more secure environment variable approach
- Added proper fallbacks with clear documentation for developers

### 4. Documentation
- Updated README.md with environment setup instructions
- Created SECURITY.md (this file) with security guidelines

## üö® IMPORTANT: Before Committing to GitHub

1. **Create your .env file:**
   ```

   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install expo-constants@~15.4.4
   ```

3. **Final cleanup (optional but recommended):**
   - After confirming the environment variables work properly, remove the hardcoded DEV_ constants from supabaseClient.js

4. **Verify .gitignore is working:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - Make sure .env file is NOT listed as a tracked file

5. **Update app.json:**
   - The app.json file has been updated with required plugins

## üîí Ongoing Security Practices

- Regularly rotate your Supabase API keys
- Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
- Consider using Expo's secure storage (expo-secure-store) for local user data
- Keep all dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities

## üë©‚Äçüíª Instructions for New Developers

### Option 1: Using Project Owner's Supabase

1. Request the Supabase credentials from the project owner through a secure channel
2. Add these credentials to your `.env` file
3. Do not share these credentials with anyone else

### Option 2: Setting Up Your Own Supabase Project

If you're developing independently or for testing, you can set up your own Supabase instance:

1. Create a free account at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
2. Create a new project and get your URL and anon key
3. Set up your database structure to match the project requirements:
   - Create the necessary tables (likely for users, posts, and sentiment analysis)
   - Define the correct permissions for the anon key
4. Add your own credentials to your `.env` file

### Database Structure Requirements

For your own Supabase project to work with this app, you'll need to set up the following (consult with project owner for exact details):

- User authentication tables (already provided by Supabase)
- Tables for sentiment analysis results
- Tables for user posts and post history
- Appropriate RLS (Row Level Security) policies
